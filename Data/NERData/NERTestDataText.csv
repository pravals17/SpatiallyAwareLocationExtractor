2,"Uddhav Thackeray and Mamata Banerjee meet, GST and demonetisation on¬†table. Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday held an hour-long meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the BJP governments economic policies such as GST and demonetisation are believed to have come up.The development is being seen as a meeting of regional parties to form a pressure group against the BJP before the 2019 general elections.Thackeray said his meeting was a courtesy call. There are areas of common concern on policy issues. We were the first ones to voice our protest against the GST and demonetisation. So has Trinamool Congress expressed concerns over these issues, he said, adding that meeting should not be perceived as political ploy against the BJP.We also discussed on taking ahead the proposal for Kolkata and Mumbai municipal corporations on the concept of sister cities, he said.A close aide of Mamata said: The discussions veered around the Modi governments economic policies, which have generated unrest among people. The aide mentioned GST, demonetisation as the issues that were discussed.During the meeting, Thackeray reportedly highlighted his partys protests against the BJP government in Maharashtra. The aide said Mamata was the first leader in the country to protest against economic reforms of the Centre by tweeting against demonetisation and GST. The Shiv Sena and TMC, despite huge ideological differences, have resumed a dialogue as they perceive the BJP to be their main political rival in the 2019 elections, a source in Bengal said.The TMC is alarmed at the BJPs attempts to make inroads in West Bengal. The resignation of Trinamool Congress (MP) Mukul Roy is perceived as a handiwork of the BJP, a political observer said. In Maharashtra, on the other hand, the Sena fears that the BJP, by allowing Narayan Ranes Maharashtra Swabhimani Party to join the NDA, has compounded their problems in Konkan region.A source in Trinamool said, In politics, the enemys enemy is a friend. Sena and Trinamool talks should be perceived in that context. Mamata is emerging as the leader of the regional forces who are not very happy with the BJP.However, Trinamool leaders also have concerns about the Sena. A second-rung leader said,  You cannot fight a battle against the BJP when you are enjoying power with them in Centre (NDA) and Maharashtra. Trinamool Congress will have to face uncomfortable questions. Second, the Senas anti-minorities politics,. specially their drive against Bangladeshis, also has Trinamool leaders worried.A senior Trinamool functionary said: In West Bengal, we have a sizeable minority population, which will never not accept the Sena style of politics.However, a Sena leader said, Sena and Trinamool are not working to strike an electoral alliance. Sena has no base in Bengal nor Trinamool in Maharashtra. Their bonding is confined to anti-Modi policies and politics.",2/11/2017

5,"Govt blinks but Asha workers to continue stir Vadodara: Gujarat government announcement of increasing salaries of Asha (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers by 50% on Tuesday came after over a month-long agitation launched by the health workers across the state. During the course of this agitation which included indefinite hunger strike, the agitated health workers have not only gheraoed BJP MLAs in Vadodara but also stormed BJP office in the city and allgedly threw bangles on Prime Minister Narendra Modi cavalcade when he was conducting a roadshow near VUDA circle in Vadodara on Sunday (October 22) evening.But the Contract and Fixed Salary Struggles Committee which has launched the state-wide agitation demanding equal pay and equal rights for Asha workers and facilitators has termed the state government announcement as merely a gimmick and an attempt to misguide and weaken their agitation in the poll-bound state. According to the committee office-bearers, there are currently 45,000 health workers in the state who are responsible for conducting all the health drives in the state. Each health worker on contract presently gets Rs 1,000 as salary every month. \We still dont know the exact amount which we will get after 50 % hike announced by the state government on Tuesday. But even if our salaries are hiked to Rs 2,000 per month, the health workers will continue to get only partial payments, said Chandrika Solanki, president of the women wing of the committee. \From Rs 1,000 per month, the government cuts Rs 200 if a Asha worker fails to attend \Mamta Divas\, Rs 150 if she does not meet medical officer, Rs 150 if she does not attend \gram sanjivani\ programme and Rs 100 if the Asha worker fails to share information with higher ups in the health department, she said. \We had demanded that all the health workers should get minimum Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 as fixed salary every month apart from incentives for conducting or taking part in health drives and surveys, she said.The committee has decided to continue its agitation to press for its demand including fixed maternity leaves, health insurance coverage and sick leaves, accidental insurance, fixed working hours and identity cards \ the benefits which are provided to permanent workers. \Our health workers are exposed to unhygienic working conditions and are expected to carry out malaria, swine flu and TB surveys. But there is no health protection that they themselves receive, she said. Ironically, while the state government announced that the salaries of Asha workers will be hiked, around 100 Asha workers in Vadodara were detained by the cops and kept in confinement at police community hall at Hazirabaug and crime branch office at Bhadra Kacheri while their mobile phones were also seized. While a group of around 50 health workers were detained by the cops on Tuesday morning when they sat outside collectorate office to continue their protest after they were not allowed to enter the collectorate. A group of another 50 health workers, who were protesting at Kothi crossroads by raising slogans against all BJP MLAs, MP, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were detained on Tuesday afternoon. Vadodara district collector P Bharathi, however, said that she had only asked the agitators not to stage protests at the collectorate as it was obstructing work in the premises. \Last week, we also had a meeting with the chief district health officer and the officials of Vadodara Municipal Corporation. Since, it was a policy level decision, we had sent our report to the state government, she said.",24/10/17

In the 2016 assembly elections, the AIADMK lost its deposit in some seats in Kanyakumari district. Thus we are not afraid of the symbol,‚Äù said Stalin.MDMK leader Vaiko, who recently extended an olive branch to Stalin, exhorted DMK cadres to campaign in all streets and bring home victory for their party. ‚ÄúIt is for the DMK cadres, who are second to none to make Ganesh the victor. The victory in RK Nagar will pave the way for Stalin to sit in the chief minister‚Äôs chair,‚Äù said Vaiko, recalling his long association with DMK chief M Karunanidhi.‚ÄúI never wanted to hurt any person or religion. There is a bid to link my speech with DMK‚Äôs prospects in RK Nagar. I make it clear that I am solely responsible for whatever I have said and DMK is no way connected to it,‚Äù said Thirumavalavan, referring to his December 6 speech on Lord Rama that raised BJP and some Hindu outfits‚Äô hackles.‚ÄúThere is no history of an inspector becoming a sub-inspector and that can happen only in Tamil Nadu and only in AIADMK,‚Äù said CPI state secretary R Mutharasan, referring to erstwhile AIADMK rebel leader O Pannerselvam taking charge as deputy CM.Though leaders were upbeat about a DMK victory in RK Nagar, cadres did not seem so confident.‚ÄúThe demands of voters are very high.

9,"Telangana: Adivasis demand exclusion of Lambadas from ST¬†list Adivasis in Telangana are agitating, demanding the exclusion of Lambadas from the Scheduled Tribes list and alleging that they were cornering 90 per cent of the reservation in jobs and education.In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh too, ST associations started a protest Sunday against the TDP governments decision to include the Valmiki and Boya communities in the ST list.In April this year, the K Chandrashekar Rao government in Telangana introduced a Bill to increase the quota for STs from 6 per cent to 12 per cent. While the legislation has been passed by the Assembly, its implementation will require the Centres nod for its inclusion in Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.ST leaders are, however, saying that the communities wont benefit by the increase in quota unless Lambadas are excluded from the ST category.Adivasis, mainly from Adilabad and Kumaram Bheem Asifabad districts, held a large protest meeting at Saroornagar Stadium in Hyderabad on Saturday. This is the first time ST associations such as the Telangana Tudum Debba and Adivasi Association, Girijana Aikhya Vedika, Adivasi Hakkula Poratha Samiti, Adivasi Students Assocation and others came together to protest.STs comprise 9.3 per cent of Telanganas population, numbering about 31 lakh. Over a lakh members from Gond, Koya, Pardhan, Kollam, Naikpodu and Thoti tribes of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh took part in the protest on Saturday.The meeting was attended by several ruling TRS leaders from the ST community, who alleged that the majority of Lambadas in Telangana were migrants from Maharashtra and Karnataka, but were taking away a chunk of reservations in the ST category meant for local residents. There is anger in Adivasi communities over Lambadas, whom they dont consider as local residents. Tribals from remote areas are unable to compete with Lambadas who settle down in urban and semi-urban areas and take up jobs, Adilabad MP G Nagesh said.ST leaders alleged that a well-oiled racket in the village and mandal-level administration is helping Lambadas get domicile and local tribe certificates.Lambadas who have settled in Telangana in recent years are also eligible for ST quota. This is unfair. They come from outside Telangana, but are getting 90 per cent of the existing 6 per cent quota in jobs or education, said Kumaram Soni Rao, grandson of tribal freedom fighter Kumaram Bheem and an ST leader.The tension between tribals and Lambadas is simmering in predominantly tribal areas of Adilabad, Asifabad, Karimnagar and Warangal.Samaiah Dora, Girijana Aikhya Vedidas general secretary, accused Lambadas of cornering various government schemes. Originally there were 32 STs in Telangana and Andhra but the Lambadas were added to the list in 1976. We will take our demand to Delhi soon.",10/12/2017

21,"Nature lovers ‚Äòmourn‚Äô banyan deaths Vadodara: On Sunday morning, a group of citizens gathered at Yavteshwar Temple compound on the Jail Road for a condolence meet. But it was not for some person known to them. The group was rather mourning chopping down of decades-old banyan trees, which has given Vadodara its name and a distinct identity. A huge banyan tree located in Maharani Shantadevi compound owned by the royal Gaekwad family was chopped a couple of weeks ago to make way for a proposed shopping mall. Another grand banyan tree located opposite the railway station was pulled down as the civic body is planning to build an integrated transport terminal there. ‚ÄúWe are not against any development projects. But there has to be a balance. Maintaining greenery and conserving environment in the city should also be a part of Smart City project. The two trees that were chopped were a part of our bio-diversity for decades,‚Äù said Milind Gadre, member of the Nature Walk group that had organized the event. The two banyan trees were a home of large number of bird and insect species too and the nature lovers had tried their level best to see that they are not chopped.‚ÄúWe tried hard to save them from being chopped by writing to all the authorities including the Prime Minister Office (PMO). However, everything was in vain,‚Äù Gadre told TOI. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had earlier promised to transplant the old trees that had to be cut for development projects. ‚ÄúOne of these chopped banyan trees has been replanted by VMC in Sama but it not being watered regularly,‚Äù said Arun Majmudar, another member of the group, who visited the spot. Members of the group offered flowers to the photographs of these trees and observed two minutes of silence. Later saplings of banyan and peepul tree were planted in the Yavteshwar Temple compound by the members. ‚ÄúDevelopment can happen without chopping such old trees that are like the lungs of our city. This was our way of protesting against cutting of trees,‚Äù said Jitendra Gavli, director of Community Science Centre and member of Nature Walk group. This group had held signature campaign and even met VMC officials to save the banyan tree in Maharani Shantadevi Hospital compound. No tree census in five yearsThe city last saw its first tree census in 2012 done jointly by the VMC and forest department. The survey done in 25 wards of VMC revealed that the city had 7,47,193 trees spread over the area of 16,261 hectares. The city had 46 trees per hectare that was way above Gujarat‚Äôs average of 14 trees per hectare. ‚ÄúThere has been no extensive tree census for the entire city since then,‚Äù said Arun Majmudar, member of the Nature Group.

24,"UP CM Mauritius-bound after rolling out red carpet to US firms Lucknow, Oct 29 () After rolling out the red carpet to American companies interested to invest in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is set to travel to Mauritius this week to invite NRIs to the state. The chief minister will be on a three-day visit to Mauritius from November 1, during which he will participate in the Pravasi Bhartiya Diwas, a mega event to woo investors, a senior state government official said today. Adityatnath is also likely to invite people of Indian origin to participate in the NRI Diwas to he held in Lucknow in March next year. During his stay in Mauritius, the chief minister will meet NRIs and explore possibilities for investment in Uttar Pradesh, the official said. He will also apprise them of the steps taken by his government to facilitate investors in the state and the measures taken in this regard. Adityanath recently met representatives of more than two dozen US companies exploring investment opportunities in the state. The state's economy will act as a backbone to strengthen the India-US ties, Adityanath said, assuring the US firms his government's commitment to providing an investor-friendly environment. The 50-member delegation, representing 26 major US firms, had met the chief minister here under the aegis of US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF). Led by Boeing, the delegation that included major US firms such as Facebook, Adobe, Coca Cola, Mastercard, Monsanto, Uber, Honeywell, P&G;, Oracle and GE Health and Cargill has shown keen interest in investing in the state. They had a threadbare interaction with state cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh, who welcomed them to UP ""to fulfil BJP's 'Sankalp Patra' by creating employment opportunities through your investment"". The ""US in UP"" engagement emulated the ""Vibrant Gujarat"" model and showcased the state's investment avenues in chemicals, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, cement, gems, textiles and engineering sectors. Singh told the visiting team that ""Yogi Adityanath government's narrative is different from the previous governments"". ""We will give you a red carpet welcome in the true spirit of Atithi Devo Bhava (Guest is equivalent to God),"" he said. For ease of doing business, the chief minister said, a single-window system has been set up under his office's supervision through which prompt clearances are granted to investors. Uttar Pradesh has recently come up with an Industrial Investment & Employment Promotion Policy to stabilise and make existing industries more competitive and to attract international and national investments in the industrial sector. Official sources said the state government has decided to organise a Global Investors Summit here on the lines of BJP- ruled Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The state government plans to combine the conclave with an event for NRIs in which prominent NRIs from Uttar Pradesh will be invited to interact with business and industry leaders. The state has been organising a UP Pravasi Diwas for the past two years in an effort to strengthen the NRIs' bond with the state and seek their help in its development. The idea now is to organise this event like a fair where NRIs's hailing from UP will be invited to Lucknow and encouraged to invest in various industrial and business opportunities offered by the state as part of a new industrial promotion policy announced by the UP government. The fair will be combined with the Global Investors Summit where the NRIs will get a chance to directly interact with the invited national and international business leaders. The government expects the joint event to attract investment from both the NRIs as well as the business leaders. A date for the events will be announced soon, the sources added. SMI ABH",29/10/17

A few of them even assembled on the beach on Tuesday evening, only to be chased away by cops who called this a rumour.The police picked up four people from the beach for questioning. They have been identified as Rajapandian, 31, of Tiruvallur, Samuthradevi, 35, of Alandur, Manikandan, 28 of Trichy and Leo Nelson, 32 of Chromepet. Rajapandian and Manikandan told the police that they had come to Marina Beach to participate in the protest, while the other two said that they were usual visitors to the beach. Police let them go after an inquiry. Hundreds of vendors had also kept away from Marina Beach.Deputy commissioner of Mylapore V Balakrishnan told TOI that such rumours affected the normal life of the public visiting the beach and those running shops. \Those spreading such unnecessary rumours will face legal action, he said.Debt-ridden and drought-hit Tamil Nadu farmers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since mid-March, in different ways, to draw attention to their plight.",28/3/17

27,"Govt mulls flexible NH toll plan to commuters benefit NEW DELHI: The government is considering offering a ""rolling contract"" for road development that will see toll collection end ahead of the contracted period if the investment and profit has been recovered, in order to blunt criticism that surfaced over Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway and Delhi-Gurgaon projects. Conversely, the contract period may be extended if the contractor, due to certain circumstances, is unable to recover expected dues. Though the proposal offers some succour to contractors, NHAI will reserve the right to take over the project to stem public opposition over ""super profits"". The ministry had a detailed discussion on this model-variable build operate and transfer (V-BOT)-on Saturday. Cases like that of DND and other highway projects where contractors are a llowed to collect toll for years have prompted the government to explore this new public-private partnership (PPP) model for road construction.  There have been several instances of protests in states including Delhi, UP and Maharashtra against the existing practice. Even a parliamentary committee had pointed out this flaw while examining the contract period and total toll collection on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.  ""The real-time toll collection in each project rolled out under V-BOT will be verified using the electronic toll collection data and other IT-enabled assessments, the parametes of which will be defined clearly,"" said a ministry official. Under this model, the projects will be bid out on the basis of total cost (including construction, financing, operation and maintenance) for a defined contract period. The lowest bidder will get the project and will build, operate and collect toll.  ""If toll collection increases beyond the projection due to high traffic growth, the contractor will recover the cost before the quoted period and NHAI will terminate the contract. NHAI will then collect toll to recover the land cost. When that amount is recovered, toll will be slashed by 40%,"" another official said. All such projects will compulsorily have 100% electronic toll collection, installation of automatic traffic count and classifier system, video image detection and other systems.  The model has been conceptualised to address all the risk factors, another official said.",19/11/17

The protest was organized by the All Assam Students' Union (Aasu).""BJP came to power in the state with a promise to protect jati, mati, bheti (community, land and homestead). We are highly dissatisfied with the role of the ruling government as they haven't shown any promptness in trying to unearth the causes behind this serious calamity,"" president of the All Guwahati Students' Union Rajmil Ali said.Soon after reports emerged of the waters of the Siang river in Arunachal Pradesh turning black, the Brahmaputra was also found to be turbid. The Siang is the principal constituent of the Brahmaputra. It joins the Lohit and Dibang rivers to form the Brahmaputra. A large section of Assamese population is dependent on the Brahmaputra for day-to-day activities. Last week, the government admitted that the water is unfit for drinking.The student body demanded that the Centre expedite talks with China to resolve the matter. Construction work by China is believed to have polluted the waters though it has denied having any role.Aasu has already demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention into the issue.

31,"OBC groups protest delay in granting ST status DIBRUGARH: Expressing displeasure over the delay in granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to the state's six OBC communities, members of the All Tai Ahom Students' Union (ATASU) took out a huge protest rally in Dibrugarh town on Friday. Hundreds of protesters marched through the main thoroughfares of the town holding placards and banners before converging in front of the deputy commissioner's office.The protest continued at the site for nearly two hours as the agitating members raised slogans against the Centre and the state government for the delay in according the promised ST status to the six communities - Tai Ahom, Moran, Motok, Chutia, Koch Rajbongshi and Adivasi (tea workers' community of Chotanagpur origin). The protesters dispersed after submitting a memorandum to deputy commissioner Laya Madduri addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Granting of scheduled tribes status to the six communities of the state was a political promise of the BJP. While campaigning in the state in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi himself had spoken about it at public rallies. The promise was reiterated during the state assembly election campaign Modi as well as present chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal. The previous Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government in the state was also in favour of granting ST status to these communities.Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale during his recent visit to Guwahati said the Centre was committed to its promise. The bill to grant ST status to the six communities can be introduced in the Parliament after the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes recommends the proposal submitted by the state government, Athawale had said.As per an estimate, if the six communities are awarded ST status, Assam will officially become a tribal state as over 50% of the state's population will fall under the ST category. The number of assembly seats reserved for STs is also expected to jump from the existing 16 to about 80 in the 126-member state assembly by fresh delimitation of assembly constituencies.Currently, 102 seats are general seats, 8 are SC reserved seats and 16 are ST reserved seats. A tribal-majority state is seen by many as the only solution to combat the illegal immigration problem from Bangladesh which has hit the state's fragile demography.However, existing ST communities in the state have come out strongly against the move as they fear that the six communities, which are more academically and economically well-off in comparison, will walk away with the advantages of reservations in education and employment sectors if they are accorded ST status.",28/10/17

The Cabinet has decided to move a draft Bill in the legislature session scheduled from February 6 to February 10. It will allow Kambala and bullock-cart racing, which will be enabled by amending the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and therefore considered a normal traditional sport, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister T B Jayachandra told reporters. Kambala was being held for nearly 600 years and does not cause any cruelty to animals, he said, adding that not a single death had taken place due to the folk sport in recent years.Earlier, CM Siddaramaiah said the government would take steps to ensure that a popular and cultural event such as Kambala was held, as per peoples wish. He also asked for the Centres support in view of the protests. While the organisers of the protest on Saturday, under the Dakshina Kannada Kambala Samiti, had intended to hold a Kambala race to defy a November 22, 2016, Karnataka High Court order staying holding of the sport, local authorities dissuaded the organisers against violating the court order.Kambala committees have filed an interim application seeking vacation of the stay; the matter is up for a hearing on January 31. Among those who participated in Saturdays protest, which demanded an ordinance on the lines of the Jallikattu ordinance in Tamil Nadu to legalise Kambala events, was local Congress MLA Abhaychandra Jain and BJP MP Nalin Kumar Kateel.

It will be temporarily housed in University of Mysore campus, and will be shifted to an independent building later,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThere are two groups of intellectuals ‚Äî while one wants the centre shifted to Bengaluru, the other wants it retained in Mysuru. Recently, the issue was resolved during Planning and Monitoring Division (PMD) meeting, where it was unanimously decided to retain the centre in Mysuru. University of Mysore has given a temporary building where the centre will start its activities. When the land is allotted and a separate building is built, the centre will be relocated to the new facility, where it will work with an autonomous status,‚Äù he said.Speaking on the status of other language centres in the country, Rao said that Kannada classical language centre is the second centre which was established after the Tamil centre. For Telugu, the centre was allotted when Andhra Pradesh was united.‚ÄúAs the state has now been split into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, MHRD will decide where the centre will to be established. For Oriya language, the state government has agreed to allot a space for the centre, and the related work will start soon. Authorities from Kerala government have not approached for a Malayalam language centre. If they approach, we will work out the modalities for that too,‚Äù Rao said.Rao suggested that Kannada centre authorities should invite experts from various branches of Kannada language and sit together to chalk out plans so that the plan can be explained before the ministry and funds can be allotted in the budget.Speaking on the occasion, Central University of Karnataka (Kalaburagi) vice-chancellor H M Maheshwaraiah said that the state government should appoint a liaison officer to chalk out plans and demand funds from the central government for the centre.Maheshwaraiah, who had earlier worked as CESCK director, said: ‚ÄúA roadmap to fill sanctioned non-teaching posts, to translate Kannada literature into English and other regional languages, to start a Kannada journal, to recommend writers who are working for Kannada language and literature in India and abroad for the President of India Award, to digitalize works and to draft an action plan for central funds should be prepared by experts during workshops.‚ÄùKannada Development Authority (KDA) chairman S G Siddaramaiah said that issues pertaining to the classical-language status to Kannada and NEET are clear examples of power politics.‚ÄúIndian Constitution speaks equality of all regional languages. But due to politics, the central government awarded classical status only to Tamil language. But only when other states protested, the status was awarded to Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam. Similarly, students were denied to write in Kannada NEET initially. But after protests, students were allowed to write the test in Kannada. No MP from the state raised their voice on the issue in Parliament. Politics should never interfere in matters regarding languages, water and land,‚Äù he said.Senior Kannada scholar T V Venkatachala Sastry said that all the 15 branches in classical Kannada centre have been grouped under separate units, where small- and medium-term research are taken up.

It is learnt that the Centre would take any step from its side only after the Supreme Court‚Äôs final call on the issue.Tamil Nadu has, however, all rights to make a law allowing Jallikattu as sports is a state subject under Indian constitution. In that case, the state law will have to address the element of cruelty in the sport and impose strict punishment and penalty or both for any violation.‚ÄúWhile appreciating the cultural significance of Jallikattu, the Prime Minister observed that the matter is presently sub-judice. The Centre would be supportive of steps taken by the state government‚Äù, tweeted the PMO after the meeting where the issue of drought in the state was also discussed.Tamil Nadu is learnt to have sought a relief of Rs 39,565 crores for tackling the severe drought in the state following failure of monsoon for two consecutive years.The PMO said, ‚ÄúThe Prime Minister also assured the chief minister that all possible assistance would be provided to the state to address the drought situation, and a central team would be deputed to the state shortly‚Äù.As protests demanding the lifting of the ban on bull taming sport jallikattu spread across Tamil Nadu, Panneerselvam rushed here to meet the Prime Minister with a request for ordinance.‚ÄúWe will soon take steps with the backing of the Centre for the holding of the sport.

Though he was supposed to return to Chennai on Thursday itself, he cancelled his return and held discussions with legal experts. The chief minister is understood to have discussed the option of ordinance and sought opinion whether it could sustain in the face of the Supreme Court being seized of the matter.Speaking about how the impasse can be broken, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told a TV news channel that the state can pass its own law.‚ÄúSports falls within the domain of the state, it does not fall within the domain of the Centre. Cruelty to animals falls within the domain of the Centre and that is why there is an act on it. So, if the state is desirous of allowing or promoting this sport, the state must bring out a law, if it so chooses. And the law must concern and take into account all the concerns of cruelty‚Äù, Mukul Rohatgi told the news channel.He said, ‚ÄúIf the state drafted law addresses the issues of cruelty, it will still be challenged in the Supreme Court, but the apex court cannot say that a state cannot have its own law.‚ÄùThe state can, accordingly, go ahead with jallikattu by making appropriate law which may have provisions of addressing the cruelty aspect of the animal sport. Such provisions must include certain dos and don‚Äôts like not indulging in any kind of cruelty like throwing stones, using knives or hitting the bull. The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, which had challenged in the Supreme Court the Centre‚Äôs last year‚Äôs notification lifting ban on jallikattu, meanwhile, said it may take the legal route if the Centre brings an ordinance to enable the conduct of Jallikattu.‚ÄúOur campaign is against cruelty towards all animals.

He said that in a family, there is bound to be differences of opinion.We will take concerns into consideration and will not damage any national interest. We are doing it in a rational way after studying each case, the defence minister said. I will welcome 100 per cent FDI in areas where we dont have expertise, he said. We are not doing it irrationally but the route is open, he said.The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch had staged protests around the country last year against the governments FDI policy in various sectors including the defence.Parrikar said that India would need a total of 1,000 aircraft in the next 10-15 years. There may be 300 to 400 fighters required, another 800 to 1,000 helicopters are required. Helicopter engine requirement alone in the next few years is going to be 5,000 engines for new as well as replacement. LCA itself will need 123 multiplied by three or four. All this is huge potential for Indian companies, the defence minister said.The government will be taking decisions on big ticket acquisitions including single and twin engined fighters in the current calendar year. Many private sector projects like self- propelled gun, C-295 (transporter aircraft) and single and twin-engine fighter jets are in an advanced stage of decision making, Parrikar said.On the fifth generation fighter to be developed with Russia, Parrikar said the project is in an advanced stage of finalisation but a few issues need to be addressed. Some issues need to be addressed with respect to manufacturing after completion  how it will be exported, what will be the approvals and what is the mechanism. We have already put a team to go into these issues. In a month or so they will put out a report. Everything otherwise is in quite an advanced stage, he said.The minister for civil aviation Ashok Gajapathi Raju who shared the dais with the defence minister said India is the fastest growing aviation sector in passenger terms in the world. The sector has the potential to graduate from the ninth in the world to being the third largest by 2022, he said.The 11th edition of the Aero India event got off to a subdued start on Tuesday. With no major acquisitions on the cards for Indian forces the air show unlike previous years is quite a low key.The Sukhoi 30 MKI, the Gripen fighter from Swedens SAAB, Indias LCA Tejas, Lockheed Martins F-16 Falcon from the US and the French Rafale are the main attractions. The Yakovlev aerobatic team, the Skycats, the Surya Kiran aerobatics team returning to the show in Hawk AJTs, and the Sarang helicopter display team are providing the stunt thrills.",15/2/17

Veteran CPI leader R Nallakannu is one of the early anti-sand mining crusaders in Tamil Nadu and thanks to his efforts, the Madras high court stopped sand mining along River Tamirabarani. Nallakannu spoke to B Sivakumar on the high court order closing down river sand quarries within six months.Q: What do you think of the HC order?A: I welcome it. But, mines should be shut down immediately as six months is a long period for stakeholders to plunder the rivers further. The sand mafia has violated all rules for the past 15 years. Use of heavy machinery has created craters in rivers because of which water released from Mettur does not reach the tail-end areas.Q: How long have you been campaigning against illegal sand mining?A: I started my campaign in 2002. As per rules only one metre of sand can be mined but in some areas mining has gone to a depth of even 500 meters.Q: Your protests have been against all governments or any particular one?A: It has been against all party governments as well as officials. Many officials have turned a blind eye to sand miners violating rules. There must be a committee to monitor and control mining of sand from river beds.Q: Won‚Äôt complete ban on sand mining affect construction work and those dependant on it?A: Yes construction activity will be affected due to the court order. Use of manufactured sand (M-Sand) is the only solution. Sand mined in Tamil Nadu river banks are being taken to neighbouring states. Illegal mining of sand has caused loss to the state exchequer to the extent of ‚Çπ95,000 crore.Q: What is the way out to curtail the sand mafia?A: There must be strict adherence to rules on sand mining. Heavy machinery must not be allowed to mine sand and officials who are abetting the sand mafia must be identified and action taken against them. These measures can streamline the sand business and will be available to the construction industry at genuine rates.",1/12/2017

Lodha described Indias premier investigative agency Central Bureau of Investigation in a courtroom in 2013 as a caged parrot and its masters voice. The CBI has become a caged parrot. We cant have CBI a caged parrot speaking in masters voice. It is a sordid saga where there are many masters and one parrot, the court had observed.Over the years, CBI has come under the scanner for repeatedly being used by either the Centre or state governments to initiate, influence, bend or close cases and investigations. Here is a list of major incidents in recent years when CBIs independent role came into question:January 3 2017: The latest incident that raised questions on the CBIs autonomous functioning is the arrest of Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandhopadhyay in connection with the Rose Valley chit fund scam. His arrest created a ruckus in West Bengal after TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minster Mamata Banerjee took to the streets with her party workers and legislators in protest. The allegations, like often, were targeted at the Central government, specifically Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing it of using the government agency against TMC for protesting against demonetisation.December 11, 2016: Reacting to media reports on the VVIP chopper scam, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala speaking at a press conference accused the BJP government of using the CBI as its puppet. A captive CBI wouldnt succeed in covering up Modi jis disastrous demonetisation mess. Time for the Modi government to answer questions in Parliament.December 15, 2015: CBI officials entered Delhi Secretariat and sealed all three floors. All offices were off limit including that of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. CBI then raided the office and residence of Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar. The raid was linked to an investigation on graft charges levelled on Kumar by an AAP member Ashish Joshi who has recently been sacked from the Delhi Dialogue Commission. The case was directly sent to CBI without going through Delhi Police. Kejriwal lashed out at PM Modi alleging that he was behind the raid and that he wanted to scare Kejriwal by using CBI.October, 2014: Former director of CBI Joginder Singh called the agency a puppet in the hands of the government. According to a report in the Hindustan Times, Singh said: The governments at the Centre actually guide the agency on how to work. The cases are opened and closed with change of guard at the Centre adding that the CBI receives written orders from influential politicians and ministers on what to do and what not to do. Not only the sanctioning of cases is planned, the interference and abnormal pressure disrupts the investigation against the accused as well.April 14, 2014: INLD chief and former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala accused the CBI of working at the behest of Congress and the agency building a case against him of disproportionate assets which was miscalculated.November 1, 2011: Former Telecom Secretary Siddhartha Behura, who was one of the six main accused in the 2G scam case, lashed out at the CBI for blocking his bail plea but not opposing the bail plea of five other accused that included then DMK Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi. To block Behuras bail plea, CBI had argued an influential person and there is every apprehension of his tampering with evidence and winning over/threatening of vital witnesses.The government had even formed a empowered group of ministers in 2013 to draft a law that would protect the autonomy of the agency.

The misery of the people has not ended, but they are still suffering, Haryana Congress President Ashok Tanwar said addressing a press conference here.Tanwar said the HPCC had summoned a meeting of party MLAs and MPs from the state here today in view of the decision to gherao the RBI office, which will be part of Congress national programme to gherao RBI offices at other places in the country as well on January 18.

It is a national programme of the Congress party (on Jan 18) and everyone will participate in the event, she said to another related question.Bansal, who is also former MP from Chandigarh, said, We have decided to gherao the RBI because it has failed to do its constitutional duty and has happily surrendered its autonomy.About the demonetisation step, Bansal said, For the first time such a thing has happened in the country, which is unconstitutional, against the law and against the rules and regulations of the RBI. This decision of the Modi government has been thrust upon the people.According to a conservative estimate, the demonetisation step will hit countrys GDP by atleast 1 per cent, which is nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore, Bansal said, adding also, cashless society is not practical in a big and diverse country like India.Slamming the demonetisation decision, Bansal said, When people deposited the demonetised currency in the banks, the banks imposed cash handling charges.When asked why Congress had done poorly in the recently held civic polls in Chandigarh, Bansal did not agree that people of Chandigarh had backed demonetisation decision of the government, saying other factors were at work here.",15/1/17

He should get the facts in the film verified by a forum of historians and then release the film.She said, Rajputs will not allow any distortion of the valiant history of Rajasthan and sacrifice of its people in fighting barbarians. If the movie does not display authentic history or takes any liberties, it will not be allowed to be released.Top Rajput body, the Shri Rajput Sabha, also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday and gave an ultimatum of November 12 for a countrywide ban of Padmavati and an FIR against habitual offender Sanjay Leela Bhansali. It said that this type of distortion of history in films like Padmavati will ruin the history and damage the highest values for which our ancestors lived and died.If people see Padmini dancing like stage actor, who will cherish the historical saga of Jauhar, rarest of rare incident of history.there is the glorification of the most barabaric, most devil, most vulgar attacker Alauddin Khilji. As you know, about 16,000 great Rajputanis of Rajasthan dedicated their lives and became martyrs for maintenance of nations prestige, religion, culture and Bharat Mata.Why we allow such glorification of our all-time worst enemy? They have also asked the PM to warn Smriti Irani as she has formally supported for release of film, so that she may be a bit careful in such important matters and withdraw her remarks.On Sunday, Congress spokesperson and Jaipur Congress president Pratap Singh Khachariyawas had said, If the movie distorts history, then it is the responsibility of the Central and state government to ban it. The government is mistaken if it believes that it can screen the movie with distorted history, he said, warning of a law and order situation if the government proceeds with the movie in its current form.A day before him, Union minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Uma Bharti, had written an open letter stating, If you are making a historical film, you cannot violate the facts. She said that even to this day, we have respect for Padmavati and hatred for Khilji. She had said that people should find a way to address the apprehensions being raised on the film.Several other organisations, such as Rajput Karni Sena, Shri Rajput Karni Sena, Antarrashtriya Brahman Mahasangh, and others have protested over the movie. The Bajrang Dal also said that it would protest the release of the movie in Rajasthan on November 10. Johar Smriti Sansthan had also called a bandh in Chittorgarh last week against the movie, which is scheduled to release on December 1.",8/11/2017

Besides, a majority of the 306 clinical establishments in the rural parts of Miraj taluka, which also includes Mhaisal village, are also illegal.This was revealed by a member of the patient welfare committee at the Mhaisal primary health centre (PHC) on Wednesday. Among the illegal clinical establishments in Mhaisal, 25 are clinics while the four are hospitals. Surprisingly, the Mhaisal PHC is just a walking distance from homeopath Babasaheb Khidrapure hospital. Khidrapure has been arrested in the abortion racket of Sangli.Ashok Wadar, a member of the patient welfare committee at the state-run PHC in Mhaisal village, said, We knew about this (illegal clinical establishments) for many years. The staff at the PHC conducts audit of these clinics and hospital every year. And the report is given to higher authorities, including taluka health officer (THO) and district health officer (DHO), every year. We don\t know why they have\n initiated any action against these clinics and hospitals all these years.When contacted, V P Sawant, taluka health officer, Miraj, said, Among the 306 clinical establishments in rural parts of Miraj taluka, most are only clinics and dispensaries. And only 15 are hospitals or nursing homes. Among these 15, eight hospitals have the registration as per the Bombay Nursing Home Act while remaining seven are running without the registration.

We will also issue show-cause notices to those running without mandatory registrations. Nana Kamble, a social activist from Mhaisal, said, Since medical officers of the state-run primary health centres have no power to initiate action against unregistered hospital or clinics and sonography centres, they are helpless. Despite being informed, the DHO has not taken any action against any of these hospitals or clinics. That simply means that he is responsible for all the clinical establishments running illegally in Mhaisal and should be punished.DHO Ramchandra Hankare said, As per the Bombay Nursing Home Act, nursing home owners should furnish documents for seeking registration, based on which I can either issue or cancel their registrations. But none of the hospitals in Mhaisal have applied for any registration. Meanwhile, a ten-day drive to identify illegal hospitals will kickstart in Sangli district from March 9.",8/3/2017

Singh Said, The SAD-BJP combine, faced with imminent defeat, had stooped to historic lows in a desperate bid to wrest these polls. The Opposition had used all possible tactics  from open threats to misleading statements and rumour mongering  to intimidate the voters, but failed miserably. Hailing the high voter turnout as a moral victory, the Punjab CM said, The people of Punjab had once again shown their political maturity and courage in fighting the nefarious designs of the SAD-BJP combine and AAP, both of which had been completely wiped into oblivion from the electoral landscape of the state.There were reports of sporadic incidents of violence in Patiala, which prompted Shiromani Akali Dal to demand a cancellation of the polls in Patiala.

73,"Why China's growing footprint in Nepal is a concern for†India Sher Bahadur Deuba has been elected Prime Minister of Nepal at an especially fragile time in the life of the 11-year-old Himalayan republic. Two years after the majority Madhesi population in the Terai blocked several trading points along the southern border with India, there remains deep-seated resentment in large parts of Nepal against the Kathmandu elite.Deuba inherits a divided Nepal, divided between the Madhesis and the upper caste Bahun-Chettris of Kathmandu Valley, with whom New Delhi has been doing business since it bailed out King Tribhuvan in 1950.But what is interesting in todayís Nepal is that India, which had supported the 2006 jan andolan against the monarchy which forced King Gyanendra to hand over power to the people; has all but distanced itself from the Madhes agitation and its demands: the right to be represented in Parliament and other state organs on the basis of population, or the one-man-one-vote principle.Some would say that states must pursue power, and that in Nepal, power has always rested in Kathmandu Valley, not the Terai. And therefore, they would say, India cannot afford to take the high moral ground and continue to interminably support the Madhesis, who constitute 19.3 per cent of Nepals 28.5 million population. They would also argue that the Indian support of the rights of the Madhesis, and consequently the 135-day blockade they mounted from October 2015-February 2016 to demand those rights, has run its course and that its time to turn the page. (Forty five people were killed in the agitation then, including one Indian national, and all of Nepal, especially the Terai, had suffered hardships as essential supplies grew scarce.) However, among the Madhesis in towns such as Birgunj, Janakpur and Biratnagar there is a feeling that India has abandoned the Madhesi cause.As the Kathmandu elite, then led by UML prime minister K P Oli, warmed up to the Chinese during the blockade, India watched uncomfortably. Certainly, it is this fear of the Chinese dragon expanding its presence across Nepal including in the Terai plains which neighbour Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and West Bengal that has forced India to postpone the big fight on behalf of the Madhesis.K P Oli began to openly woo both the Chinese as well as King Gyanendra when he suspected that the Madhesis may actually come into their own with the help of his former benefactor, India. India watched with growing apprehension as Oli and his foreign minister, the pro-royal Kamal Thapa, promised the Chinese in March 2016 that it would allow them to open another consulate in the picturesque hill town of Pokhara. Beijing had already tempted Oli by offering him Nepali consulates in Lhasa and Guangzhou.In addition, Oli agreed that the Peoples Bank of China could open two more branches in the Terai, apart from the one it already had in Lumbini, where the Chinese are helping revamp the birthplace of the Buddha. The Chinese Northwest Civil Aviation Airport Construction Group is building the Gautam Buddha international airport in nearby Bhairahawa.Then Deubas predecessor, Pushpa Kamal Dahal or Prachanda who knows India well since 2005 when he lived underground in the neighbourhoods of Delhi and Noida to escape the wrath of King Gyanendra did something interesting. He put the Chinese bank projects on hold.India, which had ironically played a key role in Prachandas dismissal in 2008-9 and helped Oli become prime minister, once again came out in support of the Maoist leader. It is no secret that Delhi, upset with Olis betrayal of Madhesi aspirations as well as his solicitations of the Chinese, persuaded its old ally, the Nepali Congress, as well as Madhesi parties to unseat Oli; soon it had brokered a rotating prime ministership between Prachanda and Deuba. Deubas ascension to the prime ministers chair last week, for the fourth time in his political life, is part of this Delhi-brokered agreement. But sometime midway during Prachandas tenure, Delhi lost its nerve on the Madhes issue, fearful that the Chinese were expanding its presence in Indias traditional sphere of influence.The Chinese were pouring money into Nepal, announcing projects everywhere, including in the Terai. Prachandas deputy prime minister, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, flew to Beijing to sign on the Belt and Road Initiative. For the first time, Nepal agreed that its defence forces would participate in exercises with the Chinese.Meanwhile, after the Madhesi andolan ended on an indistinct note in February 2016, several Madhesi leaders went their own ways. Bijay Gacchedar and Upendra Yadav floated their own parties and fell in line with Kathmandu. Others, like Rajendra Mahato and Mahant Thakur, were persuaded by Delhi to form a coalition, the Rashtriya Janata Party of Nepal, along with the smaller Madhesi parties.Delhi now hopes that Deuba, an able Nepali Congress leader, will amend the Constitution on the provincial boundary question as the Madhesis have long demanded; after all, the RJPN and others supported Deubas election on June 6.",16/6/17
74,"AIADMK in fresh factional war over Thevar gold armour CHENNAI: Caste and intraparty politics were on display on Friday when deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and supporters of AIADMK factional leader T T V Dhinakaran confronted each other in their bid to stake claim to the gold armour kept in the safety locker of the Madurai branch of Bank of India. The armour is taken out every year during Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar's birth and death anniversary observed from October 28 to 30. With the AIADMK in disarray, the big question is who would sign as the party treasurer.Both OPS and TTV belong to the thevar (backward) caste and gaining possession of the armour would mean a symbolic victory in the ongoing fight to regain control of the AIADMK and its symbol. It would also amount to a reassertion of their clout within the community , dominant in many constituencies in the southern districts. The armour was donated by Jayalalithaa in 2014 to adorn the statue of the iconic caste leader in Pasumpon.Jayalalithaa had, in the year 2007, replaced Dhinakaran with Panneerselvam as AIADMK treasurer. In 2014, the former CM, in a letter to the bank, authorized her then trusted lieutenant OPS to operate the joint account and the vault, along with the caretaker of Pasumpon Thevar Ninaivalayam (Pasumpon Thevar Memorial), who is Muthuramalingam's heir. OPS is keen to get the strong backing of his community and it is crucial to him in the power struggle in the ruling camp as well, said a senior minister and a close associate of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.On Friday, Panneerselvam visited the bank with four ministers and ten MLAs in tow, all belonging to the thevar community . The TTV camp, led by the faction's presidium chairman K Anbalagan and party organizing secretary R Samy along with advocates gained access to the bank from the rear. They (OPS camp) even came with garlands of flowers to take the armour. But, we stopped them. How can the traitors lay their hands on the armour gifted by our leader at the behest of our Chinnamma (V K Sasikala)? asked Samy .Apparently , TTV held discussions with legal experts and Sasikala for three days before sending a communication to the bank, authorizing only the heirs of Muthuramalingam to accept the armour. The jailed leader had earlier authorized the faction's treasurer and her relative M Rengasamy . I was the one who paid advance (to the craftsmen who made the armour) and was in touch with them until it was completed. They (TTV camp) don't have any documents, Panneerselvam said.While EPS enjoys support among his kongu vellalar community in the western belt, for OPS it is crucial to flaunt the support of his community in the south in the power games for supremacy in the party.",28/10/17
