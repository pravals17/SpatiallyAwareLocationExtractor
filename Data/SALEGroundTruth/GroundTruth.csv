82,MGNREGA must focus on poor regions ,"NEW DELHI: Job guarantee scheme MGNREGA should be focussed more on poor areas where residents figure high on deprivation index, according to an expert committee of the rural development ministry. In its report on better targeting of welfare schemes, the Sumit Bose committee has recommended that MGNREGA should be tilted towards regions where there is a greater concentration of landless labourers or people are suffering from multi dimensional deprivations, in order to bring about change in the socio economic landscape of the poor regions of the country . The suggestion seeks to recalibrate the job scheme instead of letting it follow a uniform approach irrespective of development gaps between regions. According to the committee, the Cluster Facilitation Teams, which aid the scheme's implementation, should be strengthened to better capture the demand for work in panchayats with higher concentration of deprived households and landless manual labour. For observers, the recommendation is interesting as it treads the risky territory where it could be seen as seeking to limit the job scheme to poor areas by cutting out blocks identified as developed.",NEW DELHI,NEW DELHI

Officials, however, said that the prohibition which has been imposed in Panaji, Margao and Mapusa so far is only a stricter implementation of the central government Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016. The ban on sale of plastic bags below 50 microns is expected to increase the cost per bag for retailers and vendors, making it harder for them to hand out the bags free of cost to consumers. A hefty annual registration fee of Rs 48,000 for vendors seeking to continue dispensing plastic carry bags is expected to either deter them further, or pressurise them into passing the added cost to the customer. Under the central government rules, the aim of collecting a registration fee from retailers and vendors is to help municipal bodies invest in a more systematic process to dispose plastic waste.","PANAJI, Panaji","PANAJI, Margao, Panaji, Goa, Mapusa"

Research conducted by Diamond Services revealed that once an HPHT grown synthetic diamond is subjected to irradiation, it no longer will phosphoresce at room temperature, meaning that it is unlikely to be screened out by many of the popularly used detection devices available today in the industry.

402,TRS not to support Bharat bandh,"HYDERABAD: The TRS will not support the Opposition sponsored Bharat Bandh against demonetisation on November 28 as the party had already asked the Central Government to see that the hardships faced by people were overcome. TRS Deputy Leader in Lok Sabha B. Vinod Kumar told a press conference that the party had taken a stand to give suggestions to the Centre as the demonetisation scheme was already under implementation. Mr. Vinod Kumar released a letter questioning the Centre's written reply to a question raised by TD Rajya Sabha member T. G. Venkatesh turning down the Telangana government's request to increase the seats of the Legislative Assembly in the State until Article 170 of the Constitution was amended. The TRS MP said the Constitution, while creating new States by reorganisation, conferred supreme and exclusive power on Parliament under Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution to enact provisions for dividing land, water and other resources, distribute assets and liabilities of predecessor States amongst new States and make provisions for contracts and other legal rights and obligations. However, Section 26 (1) in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act was tantamount to an amendment of the Constitution and had an overriding effect over some other provisions in Article 170. The Section 26 (1), if interpreted correctly, was enough to enable increase in Assembly seats. At the most, a minor amendment to the section was required to remove ambiguity and clarify its intent.","Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, HYDERABAD","HYDERABAD, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh"
