# SpatiallyAwareLocationExtractor
A spatially-aware location extractor (SALE) that extracts locations (place names) from text. It has three modules:
1. Gazetteer and PoS: It uses a gazetteer and PoS tagger to extract locations in text
2. Spatially-aware pattern recognizer (SAPR): It utilizes the data-driven patterns of place names (i.e., frequent affixes) and patterns of use of place names (i.e., locative preositions as a precursor for place names) to identify place names in text
3. Spatially-aware NER system (SANS): It uses a CRF-based NER system trained on spatially-rich dataset and the patterns generated by SAPR to extract place names from text.

The code and data were used in the paper below. Please cite the paper if you use the data and code.
