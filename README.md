# SpatiallyAwareLocationExtractor
A spatially-aware location extractor (SALE) that extracts locations (place names) from text. It has three modules:
1. Gazetteer and pos: It uses a gazetteer and POS tagger to extract locations in text
2. Spatially-aware pattern recognizer (SAPR): It utilizes the data-driven patterns of place names (i.e., frequent affixes) and patterns of use of place names (i.e., locative preositions as a precursor for place names) to identify place names in text
3. Spatially-aware NER System (SANS): It uses a CRF-based NER system trained on spatially-rich dataset and the patterns generated by SAPR to extract place names from text.
